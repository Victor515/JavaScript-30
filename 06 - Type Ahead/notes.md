1. fetch is JS-native way to handle network request and response. It returns a promise that resolves to a Response object.
2. const regex = new RegExp("...", "gi"). "g" means match globally, "i" means case-insensitive.
3. const cityName = place.city.replace(regex, `<span class="hl">${this.value}</span>`); This is a nice way to modify part of text displayed in any html.
